# 🐍 Python Design Patterns & Algorithms

Welcome! 👋  
This repository contains a collection of **Python implementations** showcasing key **design patterns** and **individual algorithms**, written with clarity and reusability in mind.

Each file focuses on **one concept only** and can be **run independently**.
